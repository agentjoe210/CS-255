Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client was a couple who wanted to create an education program for new drivers to increase the pass rate of the driving test in the area and, in the future, to the surrounding areas. The application they wanted us to design and create was a constructed software that dealt
a paid lesson service which made reservations for student drivers to pair with instructors and once their lessons were done they could also take practice tests to better secure their knowledge of driving. This would enable a higher percentage rate of students passing and make
safer drivers within the community.

What did you do particularly well?



If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?



How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?



How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
