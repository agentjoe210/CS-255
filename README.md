Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client was a couple who wanted to create an education program for new drivers to increase the pass rate of the driving test in the area and, in the future, to the surrounding areas. The application they wanted us to design and create was a constructed software that dealt
a paid lesson service which made reservations for student drivers to pair with instructors and once their lessons were done they could also take practice tests to better secure their knowledge of driving. This would enable a higher percentage rate of students passing and make
safer drivers within the community.

What did you do particularly well?

I think I did a particularly good job on the mapping of the different UML diagrams but I lacked details on the object diagram on how all of the objects worked together. The subject matter was relatively simple for me in this class and I enojoyed the mapping of the different responsibilities of the actors.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think I would change IT admin to CTO and the owner to CEO for ease of reading. I think the different attributes of both jobs fit those names better and give an air of professionalism. I would also consider adding color to the UML diagrams to make them more enjoyable to read. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpretted the users needs by utilizing a list that I could look back on without having to reread the entire interview process. The designing of their system to the desired application was intrinsic to the contentedness of the customer and is importyant if I want to grow my business in the future. It is important to keep the customer fully updated on your progress and be upfront on what ideas are not attainable within the timeframe, like our respnse to when Ian and Liam wanted the ability to edit the driving packages. Being honest with the customers helps with rapport. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approach designing software by taking notes of what the customer desires then plugging it into an object model which I can then use to create the necessary pseudocode. The actual writing of the code gets more challenging because I then have to decide which language to use and then write the code from there. For this specific project it would likely be written in JavaScript since it will be an online webpage but python would be utilized for the backend components. Lastly, I would impliment tools like Git to track changes and facilitate collaboration within my team.
